## Abstract

## Introduction
  The subject of school performance has been heavily researched in the past with most studies coming to the conclusion that household income and racial/ethnic demographics are the most predictive factors of school performance. Students who come from households with predominantly high socioeconomic status tend to perform better than their peers who come from lower socioeconomic circumstances - this trend further aggregates to the school and district level with schools located in neighborhoods of higher socioeconomic status typically outperforming those in poorer areas, as measured by metrics such as standardized test scores, graduation rates, and college acceptance rates. However, in a state as racially diverse as Texas, how well do these trends explain over versus under-performance at the district level?
